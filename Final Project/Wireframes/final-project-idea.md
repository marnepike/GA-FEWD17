I want to create a membership/splash page collecting membership info that lives on WordPress, using Bootstrap and Sass. This is really for work (who is paying for this class) so that we can have an extra splash page template. 

Could I get extra help to figure out how to make a site pull in WordPress content?

If I have time I'd also like to make a homepage with content based on my hometown co-op's site, because their's is terrible right now and it'd be fun! 

I've added the membership/splash page (might not keep the footer & nav if I don't have time to build the homepage, and would just have a "click here to continue to site" button instead of the membership info, top nav & footer).
